# quasar-docker 
This repo holds the docker setup to run the [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org) as a client developer.

If you want to work directly on Quasar, we have the necessary files in the repo itself to start a container. Directions on using them are also in the [Quasar documentation](http://quasar-framework.org/guide/quasar-development-with-docker.html). 

To work with the `quasar-dev` package, git clone this repo to a temporary directory and then copy the files of the `/quasar-dev` directory to where you'd like to start your project. Further instruction for working with the container files are in the respective directories.

### Directories

1. [client-dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker/tree/master/client-dev) - this directory holds files for developing a Quasar app via Docker. 
2. [container-dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker/tree/master/quasar-dev) - this directory holds the files, which will set up the client-dev container creating environment and is intended only for Quasar core team developers.

### Further Information

If you have any questions, please use the [Quasar forum](http://forum.quasar-framework.org/) or the https://gitter.im/quasarframework/Lobby. If you have any issue or suggestions, we'd be happy if you could report them in [Github](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker).

Thank you for your interest and support and have fun with Quasar!
