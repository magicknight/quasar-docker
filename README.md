# quasar-docker 
This repo holds the docker setup to run the [Quasar Framework](http://quasar-framework.org) as a client developer or as a Quasar Framework developer.

To work with either package, git clone this repo to a temporary directory and then copy the files of one or the other directory to where you'd like to start your project. Further instruction for working with the two packages are in the respective directories.

1. [client-dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker/tree/master/client-dev) - this directory holds files for developing a Quasar app via Docker. 
2. [quasar-dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker/tree/master/quasar-dev) - this directory holds files for developing Quasar itself via Docker. (WIP - coming soon!!!)
3. [container-dev](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker/tree/master/quasar-dev) - this directory holds the dockerfile, which will set up the container creating environment and is intended only for Quasar core team developers.

If you have any questions, please use the [Quasar forum](http://forum.quasar-framework.org/) or the https://gitter.im/quasarframework/Lobby. If you have any issue or suggestions, we'd be happy if you could report them in [Github](https://github.com/quasarframework/quasar-docker).

Thank you for your interest and support and have fun with Quasar!
